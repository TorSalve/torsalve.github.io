I am currently working on the Foundations of Extended Reality (XR).
I'm interested in the age-old questions of whether XR is an illusion and if our experiences during the use of XR are real.
Somehow, I try to study these questions from theoretical and empirical angles.
Follow my [publications](/publications) to see how it goes.

During my PhD, I looked into how haptic experiences are made.
This leads me to explore the field of haptics through the lens of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.
Quite wild, if you ask me.

I am funded by the [Pioneer Center for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/).
